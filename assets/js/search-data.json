            "content": "Knowledge Distillation[1] refers to the process where a larger, difficult to deploy model transfers its learned knowledge about its task to a smaller, faster model. This is typically used to reduce large sized models into computationally less expensive models for real-world deployment. The larger model is often termed the “teacher” model, and the smaller model the “student”. . Existing work done in the field of knowledge distillation for NLP is limited and focuses on feature-basead knowledge, wherein the student model tries to replicate the feature embeddings (intermediate layers) of the teacher model. This includes work done by Shin et al.[2] wherein they use knowledge distillation and ensemble methods for word embedding distillation, as well as Jiang et al.[3] that demonstrates knowledge distillation from pretrained BERT models achieves improvements in performance. .

            "title": "Professional Experience in a Personal World",
            "content": "Elon Musk is known for many things. CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. Richest man in the world. Buzzworthy Tweets. But perhaps lesser known for being an embodiment of self-directed attainment of knowledge. Musk engaged in many self-directed projects from an early age, ranging from “Blastar”, a self-made video game, to self-engineered rockets. Musk unknowingly serves as an antithesis to a pressing issue in companies today. No, not the Great Resignation. Rather, the overvaluation of ineffective professional experience in the job sector, which has bred a gatekept industry which glorifies its own metrics. . According to a recent study by LinkedIn in August 2021, nearly 35 percent of entry-level positions demanded a minimum three years of experience with relevant technologies. This seems counterintuitive. Entry-level jobs are geared towards fresh graduates with limited professional experience. Delving in deeper, these “entry-level” positions often deal with high-level professional tasks. The inexperienced graduates are not equipped to handle such tasks. This indicates an increasingly gatekept professional industry, entering which is now becoming a herculean task. . Professional Experience has been shown to have little to no correlation with job performance. According to the Harvard Business Review, there is a thirteen percent correlation between professional experience and true job performance. Based off a report from researchers at the New York University, Ohio State University and University of Pennsylvania in 2009, prior related experience only helps in terms of knowledge and skill, yet in true performance, there was no real difference observed. MIT Professor Eric von Hippel highlighted that knowledge is ‘sticky’ and can’t be ported over easily. In essence, professional experience has shown little relation to legitimate performance, and it can’t often be ported over to new jobs easily. . Companies are not to blame here. For instance, in the tech sector, amidst this talent crunch, there has been a rampant demand for professionals. However, companies continue to push for older technologies to be used, such as Drupal, an ancient web framework now virtually hated by the developer community. The rapidly changing nature of technology causes many to flock towards learning newer frameworks, rather than older technologies such as Drupal. Hence, these developers are unable to procure jobs at these companies. . Some may say that specialised programmes like internships do exist to provide students with a taste of the job sector. These programmes train students to be the next generation of workers in the company. They are also a major source for professional experience. However, these internships often entail inexperienced interns being relegated to busywork and not acquiring the real-world problem-solving competencies. Hence, this ineffective “professional experience” is unable to justify the legitimate experience gained. In addition, attaining these internships remain one of the most challenging tasks for a student. At this point, most internships demand professional experience or high-level degrees for entry. Overall, internships are not offering the right experiences to thrive in the corporate sector. . In essence, despite professional experience not guaranteeing job performance, companies continue to gatekeep entry level positions, and the main avenues to gain professional experience are incredibly ineffective. The ouroboric nature of this gatekeeping suggests a vicious cycle of increasing requirements for experience and limited avenues for gaining experience. . Personal projects can change this. These projects often help students understand and gain experience in specific technologies, whilst displaying their innovation, creativity, passion, and capability. Take young entrepreneur Ann Makosinski, who invented the ‘hollow flashlight’ at the crisp age of 15, which won her the Google Science Fair. Her work wasn’t just that of genius, but of creativity as well. This in unfortunately something that structured professional jobs, which lack creativity and are rooted more in mundane yet high-pressure work, are unable to achieve. . In addition, companies can use measures other than “professional experience” to evaluate skill and ability, like tests, courses and even simulation exercises or situational judgement tests, like those used by Barclays, Deloitte, and Wal-Mart. Identifying the applicant’s hobbies and interests to evaluate their compatibility with the company could be another option. A cultural fit is crucial for team-based activities. Experiences such as team sports can also be used to demonstrate teamwork and leadership competencies. . Overall, in the short-term, companies need to adopt a multimodal and strategic approach to gauge the skills, passions, and attitudes of applicants. . Identifying students and training them from a young age is another option, especially if they receive actual mentorship under industry professionals. By this, they get to solve hands-on problems in the guidance of a professional and gain dexterity in these tasks. Schools and colleges can tie-up with several corporate and research organizations for their students to work on externships and apprenticeship programmes that deal with legitimate problems in the corporate and research sector first-hand. This is something that companies and educational institutes can achieve. . But how about the student? What can students do on their own? Students can gain hands-on experience by volunteering at charity organisations. For instance, many charity organisations require volunteers to assist them in UI/UX and Development projects. The technologies used in many of these charities are mostly cutting-edge, and the experience gained from such projects can help students not only demonstrate their ability but their passions as well. . In the long-term, students should seize opportunities to gain exposure to the field, whether through proactively volunteering or via programmes implemented by companies worldwide. . Knowledge is worthless without experience, but professional experience need not be glorified. After all, as internationally acclaimed author and journalist Malcolm Gladwell said in his 2008 book, Outliers, “Practice isn’t the thing you do once you’re good, it’s the thing that you do that makes you good.” .",

            "title": "Has "Critical Thinking" gone too far?",
            "content": "I am a student in NUS High School, so I am by no means representative of the larger populace. But I wish to write this article to illustrate a key issue that I have noticed largely amongst my fellow peers - one of cynicism being passed off as “Critical Thinking”. . As our curriculum edges closer and closer to the standards of the General Paper, a now infamous assessment which is part of the GCE ‘A’ Level Examination that nearly all Singaporean Junior College Students are required to take, I have noticed a shocking twist in the way that certain people have started to act, whether that be during lessons or even during breaks. The way they speak, the way they act, the way they present themselves have all pointed to some form of large-scale condescension. Seeing your relatively hated solution as the only one that works, yet criticizing others for projects that were well-liked by assessers has became a true pinnacle of school life for myself. . An example of my experience with this has been with regards to my winning a Gold Award at the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) last year. Known widely as one of the, if not the most, important research events conducted in Singapore, the SSEF wishes to identify exemplary projects amongst the slew of new and relatively novel research done by students at Secondary and Tertiary levels. . I submited a project targetted at identifying the moment of Gait Freeze, a phenomenon that is found quite highly amongst patients suffering from Neurodegenerative Diseases, such as, for one, Parkinson’s. We used Machine Learning Models on Accelerometer Data to identify this event and developed a hardware prototype to detect them accurately. Honestly speaking, the absolute banality of our project was surpassed only by our own ambition, and we submitted the project to multiple research fairs. And then it happened. All so suddenly, everything fit into place. We had fastened the seat belts for the flight of our lives. . And when we got to the finals for SSEF, the day seemed daunting. After all, to us, presenting this project to professionals seemed absolutely crazy, given just how simplistic it actually was. In the end, that problem continued to trouble me, but we went through all the judging procedures, and not just that. We actually had fun. While waiting for the judges to roll in, we spent our time, chatting, helping each other with our homework and watching “Sherlock Holmes II” as well as “The Da Vinci Code”, ending off with an absolute stellar presentation in our eyes. The judge had managed to completely change the way I looked at my project. Sure, it was more basic that others. Sure, I wrote less code than others. But the fact was that we had conducted research that was applicable to the modern world. . But then I got the email. I found out that I had gotten Gold Award. And everyone around me went absolutely crazy. . I was originally hesitant to read the result… I figured a Certificate of Participation didn’t require me switching on my phone just to check the result. As the Chemistry lesson drew to a close, I looked around. Everything was mundane and normal. Perhps nothing had come out of it after all. And I looked through the list and saw “Gold Award” plastered next to my name. . And just as I did, my classmate decided to question what I got, since he had found out that SSEF results had come out. As I squeaked out a faint “Gold”, a sudden tirade of absolute bursts of anger came knocking by, as he expressed absolute disgust that my project had somehow achieved such an accolade. He continued to criticize the unoriginality of the project, suggesting that the only reason it had won the award was simply because it aimed to help patients afflicted with Parkinson’s Disease, and the judges were biased enough to . He stated all this, yet he himself had not actually participated in the competition. He hadn’t bothered to conduct research, instead choosing to work on other tasks, yet he continued to criticize a project he knew very little about. . Believe it or not, this behaviour has been heralded by today’s schools, with the intention being to ingrain in students the many critical thinking capabilities that are believed to be a crucial part of the learning of a student. . Yet, somehow somewhere, the definition of critical thinking has become somewhat corrupted. From identifying the many stakeholders and perspectives, we have descended to a point of considering the flaws in many works, without once considering their positive aspects. We fail to see that no matter what, any .",

            "title": "Theranos - Silicon Valley’s Greatest Disaster",
            "content": "In the post, I review this article. . Theranos has been a very clear indicator of how much trust we have in technology today. The scandal was one of the many such cases involving market fraud and the misleading of shareholders over the past few years and has been helmed as Silicon Valley’s Greatest Disaster. With an idea as incredible as was the founder’s, Elizabeth Holmes, who possessed a very limited amount of knowledge regarding medical trials and entrepreneurial methods and a small patent developed within a few five days, Theranos seemed doomed from the start, yet it grew from a simple start-up in 2003 to a highly valued company with a valuation of about 9 billion dollars in 2014. In a few short years, the medical company had grown to the point that Holmes was now the richest self-made female billionare in the world, yet all it had was a disappointing line-up of inaccurate products with fabricated results that left many flabbergasted. Holmes had somehow managed to convince stakeholders and even the board of directors of her own company to let her continue the fraud. . I feel like this is something the author of this article was unable to understand. In the article, she makes a point to somehow laud Holmes as a genius inventor who was determined and focused on her vision, yet Holmes never came under many of these categories. Holmes’ entire determination came from a childhood desire to be rich, and she was nowhere near the genius Bill Gates possessed when he dropped out of Harvard. Additionally, even the device that she had intended to design, a plan that never came to fruition, required a lot more background knowledge, especially in terms of medical implications and bioethical considerations, than would creating something like Facebook at its earliest stage. A proper tertiary education was a clear necessity, one that Holmes did not fulfil, and the patent behind the Theranos device was created in the span of a few sleepless nights, not months, let alone years of research. . Yet, the author pointed fingers at other such creators, like Facebook, WeWork and Uber CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Adam Neumann and Travis Kalanick, who, in her words, had made questionable moves akin to Holmes’ but never faced any such legal action. She brought up the implications that came with many Facebook features that were misused by others .",

            "title": "Finding Success in Research",
            "content": ". Photo by Annie Sprat on Unsplash . Reading the title, you must be thinking: “what does a high-schooler in a country like Singapore know about research?”. And you’d be right. I don’t know everything about research. I don’t understand some complex paper titles and I’m certainly unable to read them. But that’s besides the point. . My First Research Project . A while back, I took part in a small research project. At that time, I was just starting Secondary 3, otherwise known as the 9th grade, at NUS High School, and I was extremely nervous. Seniors had always warned me that Secondary 3, or Year 3, as we call it, was the worst year of our 6-year high-school experience. . And so, when I started to take part in that research project, I was decidedly apprehensive. While we did have the option of taking a research-related module in our course curriculum back in Year 2, I had pass on that in favour of a Math module, where we learnt some interesting stuff like LaTeX and what, at that moment, I didn’t know was known as mathematical research. I had no experience with creating research posters, or writing realistic research papers. I had nothing. . But that wasn’t the only thing. . While we were deciding a project, we came across a relatively mundane project, which combined some of the interests that my groupmates, who unlike me hated Computer Science and coding, and my own. The problem was that the project required experience with Machine Learning. Whereas I was slightly familiar with Data Analytics modules like Numpy and Matplotlib at the time, I was nowhere near the level of a professional Data Analyst. . I had been getting myself involved in GUI Development with Python at the time, spending my entire December Holidays on what was but a slightly functional PyCharm clone, but that was before our school brought us into what I like to call the ‘Brown Ages’. . The Brown Ages . The ‘Brown Ages’ represented the two semesters wherein our school really went all in to teach us, wait for it… Java. Java, in my opinion, is still one of the worst languages I’ve ever learnt, to the point that I’d rather code shell scripts than Java. Whereas I started to warm up to the language over the course of Year 3, my respect for the language drops every passing month, especially after witnessing the powers of Scala and Kotlin, which, mind you, are built on the same exact system as Java, that being the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). . The Covid Protocol . But soon, things took a turn for the worse. And maybe for the best. Last year started with a global pandemic that swept many nations of their feet, and thrust most, inclusive of me, into a closed-off situation. Entire schools were shut down, and students like me were left astray, locked into a cramped space with little hope of the future. . But that turned out to be a cloud with silver lining. In the meantime of a month-long lockdown, I participated in the prolific Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera, and familiarised myself with many of the most important algorithms in Machine Learning, like the ideas of regression (linear, polynomial, ridge, lasso, logistic), K-Means and even, to some extent, Neural Networks. We learnt all this in MATLAB Octave, which is basically a paid specialized data science language. Python basically managed to duplicate many of the specialized features of MATLAB Octave, with the powerful libraries of numpy and matplotlib , hence explaining the decline in popularity of this language. In summary, it didn’t take long to convert it into Python. . This truly helped me with my research project, but timing was always an issue. I was a victim of poor sleep schedules, catching only 4 hours of sleep daily, and huge amounts of stress, that too besides my research project. So I left it in stasis. For 6 months. . 6 Months Later . I started off relatively inexperienced, and decided to tinker around with a little dataset to find possible patterns. I decided to process the data with Signal Processing algorithms, and decided to look up possible techniques. Unfortunately, my ArXiv reading was relatively poor, and I was left scraping for possible option to code the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based algorithms we used in the project. . We came across a paper that did something very similar to us, but it was a bit more complex and the code was written in MATLAB Octave. Although I had learnt MATLAB Octave before, I felt that doing the project in Python would be better. And hence, I spent a whole gruesome week converting and debugging the code, continuously and incessantly. It was absolutely terrible, but ultimately it helped me a lot. . In case you wanted to see, the following was the data we already had: . . Graph of Accelerometer Data as it evolves through time. . And this was what we got after the Signal Processing had been performed: . . Graph of the Postulated Freeze Index Values, the products of the Signal Processing Algorithms. . Week 2 . Following this, with the help of some of my group mates, I was able to find out that Support Vector Machines (SVMs) would be the most efficient Machine Learning model based on the data available. But there was an imminent problem. There were 10 million data points. If we used Scikit-Learn’s SVM utility, we would have to wait for hours and hours of training, possibly days or weeks. We needed to find an efficient form of creating a model. Everything depended on this. . And then I stumbled upon a little contraption called ThunderSVM. ThunderSVM allowed me to do exactly what I wanted: run a non-deep machine learning model on a GPU. And thus, I continued to use ThunderSVM. Until I ran into a problem. I didn’t have a GPU that supported CUDA. Oh god. . So I tried to find a solution. Something that could let me use a GPU which was not on my local computer. And that is when I remembered Google Colaboratory, a software that can allow you to run your notebooks online with a GPU or even a TPU. I had previously used it in another such research-like Time Series Machine Learning project. . Flashback: 3 Months Ago . There was once a little kid named Prannaya, who decided to be very dumb. He was over-committed and was dying of Bio and yet he decided to predict Covid-19 um. . Indeed, I decided to predict Covid-19 patterns to predict the trajectory. Using the statsmodels API ARIMA function SARIMAX , Facebook’s Prophet API and Double Exponential Smoothing, I had to code. . Problem was that Jupyter Notebook wasn’t working on my laptop at the time, so I had to find another more usable platform. Hence came in Google Colab. I had been training the model for a whole week throughout the September Holidays, making them what was otherwise a project-work filled nightmare now an surprisingly terrible nightmarish hellscape. But I digress. . I wish it was over. . I guess I managed to make the model train for a while and eventually it was giving substantial results. The data can be seen below: . . We continued to find better results, but by a certain point, the above was the best data we had. We went with it. And that was it. The project was over. My suffering was over. Or so I thought. You see, even as I stared at that plot in a Colab Notebook, with a sort of bliss in my heart, I was yet to find out that there was something waiting ahead… Something that would change the course of everything. .",

            "title": "Introducing Face",
            "content": "Our Rationale . FACE, or Facial-recognition AI for Communicating Emotions, is an AI Project built as part of the Building BloCS 2021 Event AIWinpetition. This is an AI project for visual sentiment analysis based on the audiences’ face. . This application has been built off against the theme of “Inspired by Hollywood”. An unfortunate situation in Hollywood, and by extension the entire world, is the apparent lack of transparency. While one might say the opaqueness gives one a sense of security and the feeling of personal space, this becomes abundantly problematic with Peer Pressure and Societal Expectations. . Imagine a world where no one hides their emotions. Everyone is 100% transparent with one another, and no one lies. While such a world may only seem to exist in concept films like The Invention of Lying and short videos by Ryan George, the truth is that this world yields certain benefits, benefits which may affect how one works or adapts to the situation. . Take a simple example of a project at school, where one person is doing all the work while the rest slack. Now, the person can either say the complete truth and express his discomfort or hide his emotions and work on the entire project, wasting his time in the process. As the situation is, you can’t really be rooting for the option of hiding your emotions, can you? But 99% of the time, that is what the person would do, because they don’t want to be misjudged or looked at in a negative light. The societal perceptions and pressures become a bane to their very honesty. . A macroscopic example of this comes in the form of movie reviews. Critics may choose to be less harsh on a movie if they don’t want to make the director and the cast feel bad, and that is the reason that honest reviews are needed more than ever now. But that’s the problem. You can’t get honest reviews easily. Hiding your emotions will always take over. That’s why FACE was made. . FACE aims to fix this problem, by enabling a facial recognition-based sentiment analysis system. Simply put, it takes in your FACE and classifies it using a CNN to a certain emotion. That is how you felt during the encounter. This allows directors to quickly gauge how one’s feeling and engagement regarding a movie, so that they can work to tie up loose ends. It’s essentially allowing the director to fill the audience members’ shoes and understand how things work from their perspective. This technology being online also allows sentiment analysis on online platforms similar to Zoom, which makes being in the same room not as important. A possible option that arises from that is lie detection, especially during interviews. . All in all, this application will be an indispensable tool for moviemakers facing problems with getting honest feedback about their productions through text. With FACE, they will be able to view their audiences’ reactions and will get essential information to improve their movie production, using deep learning! This technology aims to allow not only you, but everyone around you, to express yourselves as you are, not as society wants you to be. Didn’t like Captain Marvel? You can be vocal about it, don’t worry. We are with you every step of you to help you FACE your fears. . Our Model . We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) against a dataset that we had with us. We trained the CNN, which was developed via the following prototype emotion model code written in TensorFlow Keras with Python: . . The model takes in a grayscale version of the image and returns the probability function. This was as part of our research, where previous papers and examples showed this to be the most accurate model found so far. We then used an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and decay of 10-6, basing our training system on the accuracy of the model. Over 50 epochs, we were able to get a final product with training accuracy of 87.02% and validation accuracy (testing accuracy) of 62.83%. . Software Development . Following the development of our model, we went ahead to separate our system into two separate segments: a Desktop Client coded in Tkinter with Python and a Web Client coded in Flask with Python and HTML. . The Desktop Client . Our desktop accesses the Webcam footage of a user to analyze faces and, based off each face, run it through the CNN. The CNN returns a dictionary containing the probability of each emotion being the case. To make the User Interface simpler for the user, our desktop client only displayed the most likely emotion. This emotion is displayed along with a rectangle that is displayed on top of the face, as found by OpenCV. The following is the simplistic UI of the Desktop Client: . The Web Client . The web client, developed with the Flask Web Framework, was developed as a prototype due to time constraints and the difficulty of integrating the front-end of the web application with the backend. The prototype captures the essence of FACE and utilises the CNN to its best ability. A user-friendly web interface first asks you to take a photo of yourself or upload a pre-existing photo which is saved as a .jpg or .png file. Following this, the analyzer can be used by clicking on the link provided and pressing a button shown, prompting one to select the image from the hard drive. Following this, pressing the submit button allows the website to run the image through the CNN model, allowing it to guess your emotion based on a facial expression. Although simplistic, under the hood lies a great Machine Learning model with a lot of untapped potential, which we believe sets it apart from other metrics. . . Figure: Analyzer Page . .
