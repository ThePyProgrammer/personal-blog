            "content": "Has &quot;Critical Thinking&quot; gone too far? . Whilst schools champion for more critical thinking amongst the students, it is noteworthy to ask just where we should stop. . I am a student in NUS High School, so I am by no means representative of the larger populace. But I wish to write this article to illustrate a key issue that I have noticed largely amongst my fellow peers - one of cynicism being passed off as “Critical Thinking”. . As our curriculum edges closer and closer to the standards of the General Paper, a now infamous assessment which is part of the GCE ‘A’ Level Examination that nearly all Singaporean Junior College Students are required to take, I have noticed a shocking twist in the way that certain people have started to act, whether that be during lessons or even during breaks. The way they speak, the way they act, the way they present themselves have all pointed to some form of large-scale condescension. Seeing your relatively hated solution as the only one that works, yet criticizing others for projects that were well-liked by assessers has became a true pinnacle of school life for myself. . An example of my experience with this has been with regards to my winning a Gold Award at the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) last year. Known widely as one of the, if not the most, important research events conducted in Singapore, the SSEF wishes to identify exemplary projects amongst the slew of new and relatively novel research done by students at Secondary and Tertiary levels. . I submited a project targetted at identifying the moment of Gait Freeze, a phenomenon that is found quite highly amongst patients suffering from Neurodegenerative Diseases, such as, for one, Parkinson’s. We used Machine Learning Models on Accelerometer Data to identify this event and developed a hardware prototype to detect them accurately. Honestly speaking, the absolute banality of our project was surpassed only by our own ambition, and we submitted the project to multiple research fairs. And then it happened. All so suddenly, everything fit into place. We had fastened the seat belts for the flight of our lives. . And when we got to the finals for SSEF, the day seemed daunting. After all, to us, presenting this project to professionals seemed absolutely crazy, given just how simplistic it actually was. In the end, that problem continued to trouble me, but we went through all the judging procedures, and not just that. We actually had fun. While waiting for the judges to roll in, we spent our time, chatting, helping each other with our homework and watching “Sherlock Holmes II” as well as “The Da Vinci Code”, ending off with an absolute stellar presentation in our eyes. The judge had managed to completely change the way I looked at my project. Sure, it was more basic that others. Sure, I wrote less code than others. But the fact was that we had conducted research that was applicable to the modern world. . But then I got the email. I found out that I had gotten Gold Award. And everyone around me went absolutely crazy. . I was originally hesitant to read the result… I figured a Certificate of Participation didn’t require me switching on my phone just to check the result. As the Chemistry lesson drew to a close, I looked around. Everything was mundane and normal. Perhps nothing had come out of it after all. And I looked through the list and saw “Gold Award” plastered next to my name. . And just as I did, my classmate decided to question what I got, since he had found out that SSEF results had come out. As I squeaked out a faint “Gold”, a sudden tirade of absolute bursts of anger came knocking by, as he expressed absolute disgust that my project had somehow achieved such an accolade. He continued to criticize the unoriginality of the project, suggesting that the only reason it had won the award was simply because it aimed to help patients afflicted with Parkinson’s Disease, and the judges were biased enough to . He stated all this, yet he himself had not actually participated in the competition. He hadn’t bothered to conduct research, instead choosing to work on other tasks, yet he continued to criticize a project he knew very little about. . Believe it or not, this behaviour has been heralded by today’s schools, with the intention being to ingrain in students the many critical thinking capabilities that are believed to be a crucial part of the learning of a student. . Yet, somehow somewhere, the definition of critical thinking has become somewhat corrupted. From identifying the many stakeholders and perspectives, we have descended to a point of considering the flaws in many plans afflicted by the .",

            "content": "Our Rationale . FACE, or Facial-recognition AI for Communicating Emotions, is an AI Project built as part of the Building BloCS 2021 Event AIWinpetition. This is an AI project for visual sentiment analysis based on the audiences’ face. . This application has been built off against the theme of “Inspired by Hollywood”. An unfortunate situation in Hollywood, and by extension the entire world, is the apparent lack of transparency. While one might say the opaqueness gives one a sense of security and the feeling of personal space, this becomes abundantly problematic with Peer Pressure and Societal Expectations. . Imagine a world where no one hides their emotions. Everyone is 100% transparent with one another, and no one lies. While such a world may only seem to exist in concept films like The Invention of Lying and short videos by Ryan George, the truth is that this world yields certain benefits, benefits which may affect how one works or adapts to the situation. . Take a simple example of a project at school, where one person is doing all the work while the rest slack. Now, the person can either say the complete truth and express his discomfort or hide his emotions and work on the entire project, wasting his time in the process. As the situation is, you can’t really be rooting for the option of hiding your emotions, can you? But 99% of the time, that is what the person would do, because they don’t want to be misjudged or looked at in a negative light. The societal perceptions and pressures become a bane to their very honesty. . A macroscopic example of this comes in the form of movie reviews. Critics may choose to be less harsh on a movie if they don’t want to make the director and the cast feel bad, and that is the reason that honest reviews are needed more than ever now. But that’s the problem. You can’t get honest reviews easily. Hiding your emotions will always take over. That’s why FACE was made. . FACE aims to fix this problem, by enabling a facial recognition-based sentiment analysis system. Simply put, it takes in your FACE and classifies it using a CNN to a certain emotion. That is how you felt during the encounter. This allows directors to quickly gauge how one’s feeling and engagement regarding a movie, so that they can work to tie up loose ends. It’s essentially allowing the director to fill the audience members’ shoes and understand how things work from their perspective. This technology being online also allows sentiment analysis on online platforms similar to Zoom, which makes being in the same room not as important. A possible option that arises from that is lie detection, especially during interviews. . All in all, this application will be an indispensable tool for moviemakers facing problems with getting honest feedback about their productions through text. With FACE, they will be able to view their audiences’ reactions and will get essential information to improve their movie production, using deep learning! This technology aims to allow not only you, but everyone around you, to express yourselves as you are, not as society wants you to be. Didn’t like Captain Marvel? You can be vocal about it, don’t worry. We are with you every step of you to help you FACE your fears. . Our Model . We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) against a dataset that we had with us. We trained the CNN, which was developed via the following prototype emotion model code written in TensorFlow Keras with Python: . . The model takes in a grayscale version of the image and returns the probability function. This was as part of our research, where previous papers and examples showed this to be the most accurate model found so far. We then used an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and decay of 10-6, basing our training system on the accuracy of the model. Over 50 epochs, we were able to get a final product with training accuracy of 87.02% and validation accuracy (testing accuracy) of 62.83%. . Software Development . Following the development of our model, we went ahead to separate our system into two separate segments: a Desktop Client coded in Tkinter with Python and a Web Client coded in Flask with Python and HTML. . The Desktop Client . Our desktop accesses the Webcam footage of a user to analyze faces and, based off each face, run it through the CNN. The CNN returns a dictionary containing the probability of each emotion being the case. To make the User Interface simpler for the user, our desktop client only displayed the most likely emotion. This emotion is displayed along with a rectangle that is displayed on top of the face, as found by OpenCV. The following is the simplistic UI of the Desktop Client: . The Web Client . The web client, developed with the Flask Web Framework, was developed as a prototype due to time constraints and the difficulty of integrating the front-end of the web application with the backend. The prototype captures the essence of FACE and utilises the CNN to its best ability. A user-friendly web interface first asks you to take a photo of yourself or upload a pre-existing photo which is saved as a .jpg or .png file. Following this, the analyzer can be used by clicking on the link provided and pressing a button shown, prompting one to select the image from the hard drive. Following this, pressing the submit button allows the website to run the image through the CNN model, allowing it to guess your emotion based on a facial expression. Although simplistic, under the hood lies a great Machine Learning model with a lot of untapped potential, which we believe sets it apart from other metrics. . . Figure: Analyzer Page . .
