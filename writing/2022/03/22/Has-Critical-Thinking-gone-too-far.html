<p>I am a student in NUS High School, so I am by no means representative of the larger populace. But I wish to write this article to illustrate a key issue that I have noticed largely amongst my fellow peers - one of cynicism being passed off as “Critical Thinking”.</p>

<p>As our curriculum edges closer and closer to the standards of the General Paper, a now infamous assessment which is part of the GCE ‘A’ Level Examination that nearly all Singaporean Junior College Students are required to take, I have noticed a shocking twist in the way that certain people have started to act, whether that be during lessons or even during breaks. The way they speak, the way they act, the way they present themselves have all pointed to some form of large-scale condescension. Seeing your relatively hated solution as the only one that works, yet criticizing others for projects that were well-liked by assessers has became a true pinnacle of school life for myself.</p>

<p>An example of my experience with this has been with regards to my winning a Gold Award at the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) last year. Known widely as one of the, if not the most, important research events conducted in Singapore, the SSEF wishes to identify exemplary projects amongst the slew of new and relatively novel research done by students at Secondary and Tertiary levels.</p>

<p>I submited a project targetted at identifying the moment of Gait Freeze, a phenomenon that is found quite highly amongst patients suffering from Neurodegenerative Diseases, such as, for one, Parkinson’s. We used Machine Learning Models on Accelerometer Data to identify this event and developed a hardware prototype to detect them accurately.  Honestly speaking, the absolute banality of our project was surpassed only by our own ambition, and we submitted the project to multiple research fairs. And then it happened. All so suddenly, everything fit into place. We had fastened the seat belts for the flight of our lives.</p>

<p>And when we got to the finals for SSEF, the day seemed daunting. After all, to us, presenting this project to professionals seemed absolutely crazy, given just how simplistic it actually was. In the end, that problem continued to trouble me, but we went through all the judging procedures, and not just that. We actually had fun. While waiting for the judges to roll in, we spent our time, chatting, helping each other with our homework and watching “Sherlock Holmes II” as well as “The Da Vinci Code”, ending off with an absolute stellar presentation in our eyes. The judge had managed to completely change the way I looked at my project. Sure, it was more basic that others. Sure, I wrote less code than others. But the fact was that we had conducted research that was applicable to the modern world.</p>

<p>But then I got the email. I found out that I had gotten Gold Award. And everyone around me went absolutely crazy.</p>

<p>I was originally hesitant to read the result… I figured a Certificate of Participation didn’t require me switching on my phone just to check the result. As the Chemistry lesson drew to a close, I looked around. Everything was mundane and normal. Perhps nothing had come out of it after all. And I looked through the list and saw “Gold Award” plastered next to my name.</p>

<p>And just as I did, my classmate decided to question what I got, since he had found out that SSEF results had come out. As I squeaked out a faint “Gold”, a sudden tirade of absolute bursts of anger came knocking by, as he expressed absolute disgust that my project had somehow achieved such an accolade. He continued to criticize the unoriginality of the project, suggesting that the only reason it had won the award was simply because it aimed to help patients afflicted with Parkinson’s Disease, and the judges were biased enough to</p>

<p>He stated all this, yet he himself had not actually participated in the competition. He hadn’t bothered to conduct research, instead choosing to work on other tasks, yet he continued to criticize a project he knew very little about.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this behaviour has been heralded by today’s schools, with the intention being to ingrain in students the many critical thinking capabilities that are believed to be a crucial part of the learning of a student.</p>

<p>Yet, somehow somewhere, the definition of critical thinking has become somewhat corrupted. From identifying the many stakeholders and perspectives, we have descended to a point of considering the flaws in many works, without once considering their positive aspects. We fail to see that no matter what, any</p>
