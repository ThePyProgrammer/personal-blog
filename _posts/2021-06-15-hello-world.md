# Hello World!

Hello, my snow-white American friends, let's heat up the barbecue and roast it till we're all obese.

I'm just kidding, I'm vegetarian so I can't use a barbecue for much.

My name is Prannaya Gupta, but you can call me (and pronounce my name as) Prannay. I am currently a Year 4 Student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) High School of Mathematics and Science. I am majoring in Computer Science (with an honours course from the NUS School of Computing (SoC)), Physics (with training for Physics Olympiad as an elective module), Mathematics and Chemistry.
