title: Theranos: Silcon Valley’s Greatest Disaster
---

In the post, I review [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/opinion/elizabeth-holmes-trial-sexism.html).

Theranos has been a very clear indicator of how much trust we have in technology today. The scandal was one of the many such cases involving market fraud and the misleading of shareholders over the past few years and has been helmed as Silicon Valley’s Greatest Disaster. With an idea as incredible as was the founder’s, Elizabeth Holmes, who possessed a very limited amount of knowledge regarding medical trials and entrepreneurial methods and a small patent developed within a few five days, Theranos seemed doomed from the start, yet it grew from a simple start-up in 2003 to a highly valued company with a valuation of about 9 billion dollars in 2014. In a few short years, the medical company had grown to the point that Holmes was now the richest self-made female billionare in the world, yet all it had was a disappointing line-up of inaccurate products with fabricated results that left many flabbergasted. Holmes had somehow managed to convince stakeholders and even the board of directors of her own company to let her continue the fraud.

I feel like this is something the author of this article was unable to understand. In the article, she makes a point to somehow laud Holmes as a genius inventor who was determined and focused on her vision, yet Holmes never came under many of these categories. Holmes’ entire determination came from a childhood desire to be rich, and she was nowhere near the genius Bill Gates possessed when he dropped out of Harvard. Additionally, even the device that she had intended to design, a plan that never came to fruition, required a lot more background knowledge, especially in terms of medical implications and bioethical considerations, than would creating something like Facebook at its earliest stage. A proper tertiary education was a clear necessity, one that Holmes did not fulfil, and the patent behind the Theranos device was created in the span of a few sleepless nights, not months, let alone years of research.

Yet, the author pointed fingers at other such creators, like Facebook, WeWork and Uber CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Adam Neumann and Travis Kalanick, who, in her words, had made questionable moves akin to Holmes’ but never faced any such legal action. She brought up the implications that came with many Facebook features that were misused by others
